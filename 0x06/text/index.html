    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.
        On her desk, laying between the copies of <em>nature, new Scientist,</em> and scientific 
        journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i>On the Road.</i> It had 
        been Molly's favourite book since college and the longer she spent in these four walls the more 
        she felt she needed to be free.
    </p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an <strong>Oscar Wild</strong>
        quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>
        although many considered her piorneering work, unraveling the secretes of the llama
        <abbr title="Dioxybolonucleac Acid"> DNA</abbr>, 
        to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em>think she had somwthing better to do.
